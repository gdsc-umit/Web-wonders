            <p>
            <b>Taylor Alison Swift</b> (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Born in West Reading,<br>
            Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She<br>
            signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records<br>
            in 2005 and released her eponymous debut studio album in 2006.
            </p>
            <p>
            Swift explored country pop on her second and third studio albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010). The success<br>
            the former's singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" on both country and pop radio established Swift as one of<br>
            music's leading crossover artists. She experimented with pop, rock, and electronic genres on her fourth studio album,<br>
            Red (2012). Her fifth, the synth-pop album 1989 (2014), transformed her status from country to pop, supported by the<br>
            Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". After media scrutiny on her personal<br>
            life, Swift released her urban-influenced sixth studio album, Reputation (2017).

            Parting ways with Big Machine to sign with Republic Records in 2018, which resulted in a controversy over the ownership<br>
            of her masters, Swift released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019). After consistent commercial success in the 2010s,<br>
            Swift ventured into indie folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, Folklore and Evermore (2020).<br>
            Her songwriting on the two albums, inspired by escapism during the COVID-19 pandemic, earned critical acclaim for its<br>
            nuanced storytelling. Besides music, Swift has played various supportive acting roles in films such as Valentine's Day (2010)<br>
            and Cats (2019). She also released the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana and the self-directed concert special<br>
            Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions in 2020.

            Having sold over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Her accolades<br>
            include 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), an Emmy Award, 12 Country Music Association Awards,<br>
            25 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins for a female artist), 32 American Music Awards (the most wins for an artist) and<br>
            49 Guinness World Records. She featured on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015), and numerous power<br>
            rankings such as the Time 100 and the Forbes Celebrity 100. Named the Woman of the 2010s Decade by Billboard and the Artist<br>
            of the Decade by the American Music Awards, Swift has been recognized as an advocate for artists' rights and women's<br>
            empowerment in the music industry.
